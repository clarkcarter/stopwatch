add milliseconds to Timer
add 'Timer' title
slider increment to nearest 10 seconds?
add optional 'tick' sound every second (toggled on and off with checkbox)
add optional 'alarm' sound on completion (toggled on and off with checkbox)
add styling (possibly from semantic ui)
extract components for cleaner, reusable code
how do lifecycle events work with this app? - why do I need them and what do they do?
stop timer when it reaches zero.
